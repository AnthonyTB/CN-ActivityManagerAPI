## So what is 'Code Ninjas'?

Code Ninjas is a franchise program where mentors also known as Senseis teach children ages 7 - 14 the basics of coding. We start out using Scratch to teach kids the fundamentals of the thought process and syntax. After that we teach them JavaScript then Lua & C#. We use a video platform with a IDE to keep kids visually interested. Theres also tons of cool summer programs that focus on robotics and modding Roblox & Minecraft games.

## So what is 'The Activity Manager'?

The Activity Manager is a small React web app with 3 routes and only 7 components. When you first access the web app you are greeted by a Login route. This is a private app so you can't create accounts guest will be able to access the app via the demo credentials. Once logged in under the mentor account or demo account you will have full access to the app. There's a timer that once started and the time runs out will select a random item from the list based on a random generated number between 1 and the list length. Guest and mentors also have the ability to create and delete activities. I also created a student view that way the kids would be able to interact with the app while on their laptops. While in the student view they only have access to creating activities and viewing the activity list.
